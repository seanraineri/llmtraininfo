TI  - Biomarker-Guided Dietary Supplementation: A Narrative Review of Precision in 
      Personalized Nutrition.

AB  - Background: Dietary supplements (DS) are widely used to address nutritional 
      deficiencies and promote health, yet their indiscriminate use often leads to 
      reduced efficacy, adverse effects, and safety concerns. Biomarker-driven 
      approaches have emerged as a promising strategy to optimize DS prescriptions, 
      ensuring precision and reducing risks associated with generic recommendations. 
      Methods: This narrative review synthesizes findings from key studies on 
      biomarker-guided dietary supplementation and the integration of artificial 
      intelligence (AI) in biomarker analysis. Key biomarker categories-genomic, 
      proteomic, metabolomic, lipidomic, microbiome, and immunological-were reviewed, 
      alongside AI applications for interpreting these biomarkers and tailoring 
      supplement prescriptions. Results: Biomarkers enable the identification of 
      deficiencies, metabolic imbalances, and disease predispositions, supporting 
      targeted and safe DS use. For example, genomic markers like MTHFR polymorphisms 
      inform folate supplementation needs, while metabolomic markers such as glucose 
      and insulin levels guide interventions in metabolic disorders. AI-driven tools 
      streamline biomarker interpretation, optimize supplement selection, and enhance 
      therapeutic outcomes by accounting for complex biomarker interactions and 
      individual needs. Limitations: Despite these advancements, AI tools face 
      significant challenges, including reliance on incomplete training datasets and a 
      limited number of clinically validated algorithms. Additionally, most current 
      research focuses on clinical populations, limiting generalizability to healthier 
      populations. Long-term studies remain scarce, raising questions about the 
      sustained efficacy and safety of biomarker-guided supplementation. Regulatory 
      ambiguity further complicates the classification of supplements, especially when 
      combinations exhibit pharmaceutical-like effects. Conclusions: Biomarker-guided 
      DS prescription, augmented by AI, represents a cornerstone of personalized 
      nutrition. While offering significant potential for precision and efficacy, 
      advancing these strategies requires addressing challenges such as incomplete AI 
      data, regulatory uncertainties, and the lack of long-term studies. By overcoming 
      these obstacles, clinicians can better meet individual health needs, prevent 
      diseases, and integrate precision nutrition into routine care.
